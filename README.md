# Web Traffic Generator

A simple Python-based web traffic generator that visits random websites on the internet. This tool is designed to run in Docker and can generate realistic web traffic patterns.

## Features

- üöÄ **Multi-threaded**: Concurrent requests with configurable worker count
- üåê **Realistic Traffic**: Visits popular websites with realistic delays
- üìä **Statistics**: Detailed logging and performance metrics
- üê≥ **Docker Ready**: Easy deployment with Docker and Docker Compose
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Configurable**: Customizable request patterns and timing
- üîí **Secure**: Runs as non-root user in container

## Quick Start

### Using Docker Compose (Recommended)

1. **Build and run the container:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

2. **Run in background:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d --build
   ```

3. **View logs:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs -f
   ```

4. **Stop the container:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

### Using Docker directly

1. **Build the image:**
   ```bash
   docker build -t traffic-generator .
   ```

2. **Run the container:**
   ```bash
   # Continuous mode (default)
   docker run --name traffic-generator traffic-generator
   
   # Specific number of requests
   docker run --name traffic-generator traffic-generator python traffic_generator.py --requests 10
   
   # Custom configuration
   docker run --name traffic-generator traffic-generator python traffic_generator.py --continuous --workers 5 --delay-min 1 --delay-max 5
   ```

## Configuration Options

### Command Line Arguments

| Argument | Short | Default | Description |
|----------|-------|---------|-------------|
| `--requests` | `-r` | All websites | Number of requests to make |
| `--continuous` | `-c` | False | Run continuously until stopped |
| `--workers` | `-w` | 5 | Number of concurrent workers |
| `--delay-min` | | 1.0 | Minimum delay between requests (seconds) |
| `--delay-max` | | 5.0 | Maximum delay between requests (seconds) |
| `--timeout` | `-t` | 10 | Request timeout in seconds |

### Usage Examples

```bash
# Visit all websites once
python traffic_generator.py

# Visit 10 random websites
python traffic_generator.py --requests 10

# Run continuously with 3 workers
python traffic_generator.py --continuous --workers 3

# Fast traffic generation (1-3 second delays)
python traffic_generator.py --continuous --workers 10 --delay-min 1 --delay-max 3

# Slow, realistic traffic (5-15 second delays)
python traffic_generator.py --continuous --workers 2 --delay-min 5 --delay-max 15

# Custom timeout for slow connections
python traffic_generator.py --timeout 30 --continuous
```

## Docker Compose Configuration

The `docker-compose.yml` file includes several pre-configured scenarios. You can modify the `command` line to use different configurations:

```yaml
# For a specific number of requests:
command: ["python", "traffic_generator.py", "--requests", "10", "--workers", "5"]

# For faster traffic:
command: ["python", "traffic_generator.py", "--continuous", "--workers", "10", "--delay-min", "1", "--delay-max", "3"]

# For slower, more realistic traffic:
command: ["python", "traffic_generator.py", "--continuous", "--workers", "2", "--delay-min", "5", "--delay-max", "15"]
```

## Websites Visited

The traffic generator visits a curated list of popular websites including:

- **Search & Social**: Google, Reddit, Twitter, LinkedIn
- **Tech & Development**: GitHub, Stack Overflow, Dev.to, Hacker News
- **News & Media**: CNN, BBC, TechCrunch, The Verge
- **Education**: Coursera, edX, freeCodeCamp, Codecademy
- **Research**: arXiv, ResearchGate, Nature, Science
- **And many more...**

## Logging

The application provides detailed logging with:
- Request status and timing
- Success/failure rates
- Performance statistics
- Error handling

Logs are written to both console and `traffic_generator.log` file.

## Security Considerations

- Runs as non-root user in Docker container
- Uses realistic User-Agent headers
- Configurable timeouts to prevent hanging requests
- Graceful error handling for network issues

## Monitoring

You can monitor the traffic generator using:

```bash
# View real-time logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Check container status
docker ps

# View resource usage
docker stats traffic-generator
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Container exits immediately:**
   - Check logs: `docker-compose logs`
   - Verify network connectivity
   - Check if websites are accessible

2. **High failure rate:**
   - Increase timeout: `--timeout 30`
   - Reduce worker count: `--workers 2`
   - Check network stability

3. **Too much traffic:**
   - Increase delays: `--delay-min 5 --delay-max 15`
   - Reduce workers: `--workers 1`

### Performance Tuning

- **For high-traffic scenarios**: Increase workers, reduce delays
- **For realistic traffic**: Use 2-3 workers with 5-15 second delays
- **For testing**: Use 1-2 workers with longer delays
